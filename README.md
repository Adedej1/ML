# Air Pollution Prediction and Classification

Overview

Air pollution is a critical issue affecting health, the environment, and overall quality of life. This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to predict air pollution levels and classify conditions into four distinct factors. The analysis and modeling are performed using R programming, ensuring a robust and reliable approach

# Key Features

KNN Classification Model: Implements the KNN algorithm to classify air quality conditions based on input features.
Classification: Groups air quality into four defined factors for better interpretability and actionable insights.
Scalable and Reproducible: Code is modular and well-documented for easy scalability and reproducibility.

# Classification Factors

The air conditions are categorized into four groups:

Good: Minimal air pollution, safe for sensitive groups.

Moderate: Acceptable air quality with slight concerns for sensitive populations.

Poor: Air pollution may pose health risks, especially to vulnerable groups.

Hazardous: Severe air pollution requiring immediate attention and action.

Technologies Used

R Programming Language: Core language for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Primary algorithm for classifying air quality conditions.
Usage

Load the dataset and preprocess it using the provided script (data_preprocessing.R).

Train the KNN model using knn_model_training.R.

Predict air quality levels using prediction_script.R.
